# Login Page in Java
Login page with data encryption and decryption of credentials.

***************************************************************
v1.5 has been released, check changelogs file for more details.
***************************************************************

This code is solely written in Java by Ayu and its free to use as long as you don't consider the code as your's.

Details:
This program will show a login page as soon as you run it, and as soon as you enter your credentials and press "Sign Up", it will encrypt your credentials and save it to "C:\Users\username\Documents\Details\Credentials.txt".  ̶N̶o̶t̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶n̶c̶r̶y̶p̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶v̶e̶r̶y̶ ̶b̶a̶s̶i̶c̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶c̶r̶a̶c̶k̶e̶d̶ ̶e̶a̶s̶i̶l̶y̶.̶

Now you can use the same credentials to login (or run the real program) as long as the "Credentials.txt" is not deleted or modified manually. The program will read and decrypt the credentials in the file and compare it to the credentials you entered, if both matches, then it will print "IT'S WORKING!" (You can change the function) and will close the GUI.

Features of the program:
* Can store credentials for future login (Credentials will be encrypted)
* Can save many credentials
* You can use it to create instance of other class and it will work as a login system
* Can change theme of the page (Light and Dark)
* and Many More!
